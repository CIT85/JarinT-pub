# HTML Project: Static Travel Agency Website

## Why I Chose This Topic

I chose to create a **Static Travel Agency Website** because it is a perfect project to practice and showcase my HTML and CSS skills. This topic allows me to design a visually engaging and functional website without the need for JavaScript or back-end logic. Travel websites are dynamic and colorful by nature, giving me an opportunity to work with layouts, typography, and imagery creatively. Additionally, it allows me to structure information into clear, organized sections while focusing solely on the visual design and user experience. It's a great way to build something practical, relatable, and professional.
